# Micro-bit-calculator

This is a simple calculator program for micro:bit that has been made using MakeCode.

# How it works
The initial number is 5, but you can change it from the code.

-- By pressing the A button, the number goes up by 1

-- By pressing the B button, the number goes down by 1

-- By leaning the micro:bit frontwards, it multiples the number by 2

-- By leaning the micro:bit backwards, it divides the number by 2
